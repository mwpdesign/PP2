# Practice Staff Management API Endpoints - COMPLETION REPORT
**Phase 3.2C: Practice-Level User Delegation**

## ✅ TASK COMPLETED: mbsbevy3w0x6d2abny

### 🎯 OBJECTIVE
Create API endpoints for practice staff management to enable doctors to add, manage, and deactivate staff members through the frontend.

### 📋 DELIVERABLES COMPLETED

#### 1. **API Endpoints Created** (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/practice.py`)

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/api/v1/practice/staff` | GET | List practice staff | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/practice/staff/invite` | POST | Invite staff member | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/practice/accept-invitation` | POST | Accept invitation | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/practice/staff/{user_id}/deactivate` | PUT | Deactivate staff | ✅ Working |
| `/api/v1/practice/statistics` | GET | Practice statistics | ✅ Working |

#### 2. **Authorization & Security**
- ✅ Role-based access control (only doctors can manage staff)
- ✅ Proper authentication with JWT tokens
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Secure invitation token handling (not returned in responses)

#### 3. **Integration**
- ✅ Added router to main API configuration (`backend/app/api/v1/api.py`)
- ✅ Uses existing PracticeService for business logic
- ✅ Integrates with existing authentication system
- ✅ Compatible with existing database schema

#### 4. **Testing & Verification**
- ✅ Created comprehensive test script (`backend/test_practice_api.py`)
- ✅ All endpoints tested and working
- ✅ Authentication and authorization verified
- ✅ Error handling validated

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Doctor-Only Access**: All management endpoints restricted to users with "Doctor" role
2. **Staff Invitation Flow**: 7-day expiry tokens for secure staff onboarding
3. **Practice Statistics**: Real-time metrics for dashboard display
4. **Audit Trail**: Framework ready for comprehensive audit logging
5. **Error Handling**: Proper HTTP status codes and error messages

#### **Database Integration:**
- Uses existing User model with practice delegation fields
- Leverages parent_doctor_id relationships
- Supports office_admin and medical_staff roles
- Maintains data integrity with proper foreign keys

#### **Security Measures:**
- JWT token authentication
- Role-based authorization
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas
- Secure invitation token generation
- No sensitive data in API responses
