# Healthcare IVR Platform - Incident Response Playbook

## Incident Classification Matrix

### Severity Levels

#### Critical (P0)
- Complete system outage
- Security breach with PHI exposure
- Regulatory compliance violation
- Data loss or corruption
- Response Time: Immediate (< 15 minutes)

#### High (P1)
- Partial system outage
- Performance degradation affecting >50% users
- Security incident without PHI exposure
- Failed backup with no redundancy
- Response Time: < 30 minutes

#### Medium (P2)
- Non-critical service disruption
- Performance degradation affecting <50% users
- Failed backup with redundancy
- Minor security events
- Response Time: < 2 hours

#### Low (P3)
- Cosmetic issues
- Minor performance issues
- Single user problems
- Non-critical alerts
- Response Time: < 24 hours

## Initial Response Protocol

### 1. Incident Detection
```bash
# Check system status
aws health describe-events --filter '{"eventStatusCodes":["open","upcoming"]}'

# Review recent CloudWatch alarms
aws cloudwatch describe-alarm-history --start-date $(date -d '24 hours ago' -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")

# Check security alerts
aws securityhub get-findings --filter '{"RecordState":[{"Value":"ACTIVE","Comparison":"EQUALS"}]}'
```

### 2. Assessment and Triage
1. Identify affected systems
2. Determine incident severity
3. Establish incident timeline
4. Document initial findings
5. Notify appropriate team members

### 3. Immediate Actions
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Enable enhanced monitoring
3. Preserve evidence and logs
4. Start incident timeline documentation
5. Establish communication channels

## Response Procedures by Type

### Security Incidents

#### 1. Unauthorized Access
```bash
# Review CloudTrail logs
aws cloudtrail lookup-events --lookup-attributes AttributeKey=EventName,AttributeValue=ConsoleLogin

# Check IAM changes
aws iam list-users
aws iam list-roles
aws iam list-access-keys

# Review security group changes
aws ec2 describe-security-groups
```

#### 2. Data Breach
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Revoke compromised credentials
3. Enable enhanced logging
4. Notify security team
5. Begin forensic analysis

### System Outages

#### 1. ECS Service Failure
```bash
# Check service status
aws ecs list-services --cluster healthcare-ivr-cluster
aws ecs describe-services --cluster healthcare-ivr-cluster --services [SERVICE_NAME]

# Review recent task failures
aws ecs list-tasks --cluster healthcare-ivr-cluster --desired-status STOPPED
aws ecs describe-tasks --cluster healthcare-ivr-cluster --tasks [TASK_ARN]
```

#### 2. Database Issues
```bash
# Check RDS status
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier [INSTANCE_ID]

# Review performance insights
aws rds describe-db-instance-performance-insights --db-instance-identifier [INSTANCE_ID]
```

### Backup Failures

#### 1. Failed Backup Jobs
```bash
# List failed backups
aws backup list-backup-jobs --by-state FAILED

# Check backup vault
aws backup list-backup-vaults
aws backup list-recovery-points-by-backup-vault --backup-vault-name [VAULT_NAME]
```

#### 2. Recovery Testing
```bash
# Initiate test restore
aws backup start-restore-job \
  --recovery-point-arn [ARN] \
  --metadata '{"target-database":"restore-test"}'
```

## Communication Templates

```

## Post-Incident Procedures

### 1. Root Cause Analysis
1. Collect all incident logs
2. Review system metrics
3. Interview involved parties
4. Document timeline
5. Identify contributing factors

### 2. Documentation Requirements
- Incident timeline
- System logs
- Actions taken
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention measures
- Compliance impact assessment

### 3. Follow-up Actions
1. Update runbooks
2. Implement preventive measures
3. Update monitoring
4. Schedule training
5. Review compliance impact

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Breach Assessment
1. Determine if PHI was exposed
2. Document extent of exposure
3. Identify affected individuals
4. Prepare notification plan
5. Document mitigation steps

### Regulatory Reporting
1. Determine reporting requirements
2. Prepare incident documentation
3. Submit required reports
4. Track response deadlines
5. Document all communications
