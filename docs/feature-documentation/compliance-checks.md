# Compliance Checks

## Description
This feature ensures all operations adhere to HIPAA and other regulatory standards, including automated checks for data encryption, audit logging, and territory validation.

## User Flow
Admins initiate compliance scans, review reports, and address any issues flagged in the system.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/compliance/checks`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "territory_id": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "checks": "array",
      "status": "compliant/non-compliant"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
Compliance logs are stored in a 'compliance_logs' table with fields like check_type, result, and timestamp.

## Frontend Components
Includes ComplianceDashboard and CheckReport components in React with TypeScript for monitoring and reporting.

## Security Considerations
All checks include PHI handling verification, with alerts for potential violations.

## Testing
Unit tests for check logic using Jest; integration tests for compliance workflows with pytest.
