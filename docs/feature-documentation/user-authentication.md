# User Authentication

## Description
This feature handles user login, registration, and authentication using JWT-based patterns to ensure secure access, maintaining existing auth standards as per project rules.

## User Flow
Users enter credentials on the login page, which sends a request to the backend for verification, then redirects to the dashboard upon success.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/auth/login`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "username": "string",
      "password": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "token": "jwt-token-string"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
Users are stored in a 'users' table with fields like id, username, hashed_password, and territory_id for access control.

## Frontend Components
Includes LoginForm and AuthContext components in React with TypeScript for state management.

## Security Considerations
Uses JWT for token-based auth, with territory validation and encryption for sensitive data via AWS KMS.

## Testing
Unit tests for login logic using Jest; integration tests for API calls with pytest.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project locally from the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Set up the virtual environment (for Python backend):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver  # or uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Common issue: Authentication failures due to invalid tokens; solution: Ensure CORS is configured correctly.

## Future Enhancements
Add multi-factor authentication (MFA) support.
