# IVR System Integration

## Description
This feature integrates the IVR system for interactive voice responses, handling calls, patient interactions, and real-time data exchange with HIPAA compliance.

## User Flow
Users interact via voice commands, which trigger backend processes for queries like appointment scheduling or status checks.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/ivr/interact`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "call_id": "string",
      "user_input": "string",
      "territory_id": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "response_text": "string",
      "next_action": "string"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
IVR interactions are logged in an 'ivr_logs' table with fields like call_id, user_input, and response.

## Frontend Components
Includes IVRInterface components in React for simulation and monitoring.

## Security Considerations
All interactions are recorded with audit logs, ensuring PHI is encrypted and territory access is validated.

## Testing
Unit tests for input processing using Jest; integration tests for IVR flows with pytest.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project locally from the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Set up the virtual environment (for Python backend):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver  # or uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Common issue: IVR response delays; solution: Check network connectivity and API timeouts.

## Future Enhancements
Add voice recognition improvements and multi-language support.
