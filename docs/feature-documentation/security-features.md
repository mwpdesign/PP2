# Security Features

## Description
This feature encompasses security measures like encryption, access control, audit logging, and threat detection to maintain HIPAA compliance and protect sensitive data.

## User Flow
Admins configure security settings, monitor logs, and respond to alerts for potential breaches.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/security/logs`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "territory_id": "string",
      "time_range": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "logs": "array",
      "alerts": "array"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
Security logs are stored in a 'security_logs' table with fields like event_type, timestamp, and user_id.

## Frontend Components
Includes SecurityDashboard and AuditLogViewer components in React with TypeScript for monitoring.

## Security Considerations
Implements rate limiting, input sanitization, and AWS KMS for encryption, with real-time alerts for anomalies.

## Testing
Unit tests for encryption logic using Jest; integration tests for security workflows with pytest.

## Installation Instructions
To install this project locally from the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Set up the virtual environment (for Python backend):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver  # or uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

6. For the frontend, navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting
Common issue: Access control errors; solution: Verify user roles and permissions.

## Future Enhancements
Add advanced threat detection with machine learning integration.
