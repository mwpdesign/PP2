# Analytics and Reporting

## Description
This feature provides analytics dashboards and reports on system usage, patient interactions, and performance metrics, with data aggregation and visualization tools.

## User Flow
Users select report types, filter by territory or date, and view interactive dashboards for insights.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/analytics/reports`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "territory_id": "string",
      "date_range": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "report_data": "array",
      "metrics": "object"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
Analytics data is stored in 'analytics_logs' and 'reports' tables with fields like timestamp, user_id, and aggregated_metrics.

## Frontend Components
Includes AnalyticsDashboard and ReportChart components in React with TypeScript for data visualization.

## Security Considerations
Data access is restricted by territory, with aggregated reports to avoid exposing PHI directly.

## Testing
Unit tests for data aggregation using Jest; integration tests for report generation with pytest.
