# Order Management

## Description
This feature handles the creation, tracking, and fulfillment of orders, incorporating territory validation and real-time status updates.

## User Flow
Users create orders, track status, and manage logistics, with notifications for changes.

## API Endpoints
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/orders`
  - **Request**: 
    ```json
    {
      "patient_id": "string",
      "items": "array",
      "territory_id": "string"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**: 
    ```json
    {
      "order_id": "string",
      "status": "pending"
    }
    ```

## Database Schema
Orders are stored in an 'orders' table with fields like id, patient_id, status, and territory_id.

## Frontend Components
Includes OrderForm and OrderStatus components in React with TypeScript for order handling.

## Security Considerations
Ensures territory-based access and logs all order changes for audit compliance.

## Testing
Unit tests for order validation using Jest; integration tests for order processing with pytest.
