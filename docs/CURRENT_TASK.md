# Current Development Status

## Current Phase: Phase 11 - Backend Integration for New Workflow & Phase 9 - Security & Compliance Hardening
## Previous Phase: âœ… Phase 10 (Frontend Focused) - Workflow Optimization, Design Standardization & Demo Preparation (COMPLETED)

### Completed Features (from previous Frontend-Focused Phase):
1. âœ… **Frontend Order Management System**
   - Frontend for order creation from IVR concepts.
   - Frontend status tracking with audit trail display concepts.
   - Frontend for insurance verification display.
   - Frontend for real-time notification display (WebSocket client-side).
   - Territory-based access control concepts in UI.
   - HIPAA compliance considerations in UI design.
   - Performance optimizations in frontend rendering.
   - Streamlined three-stage workflow (Pending â†’ Preparing â†’ Shipped) in UI.
   - One-click status progression in UI.
   - Integrated shipping form in UI (carrier selection, document upload UI).
   - "Mark as Received" UI for doctors.

2. âœ… **Frontend Order Status Tracking & UI**
   - Status transition validation display in UI.
   - Real-time WebSocket update handling in UI.
   - Territory-based access control UI elements.
   - UI for HIPAA-compliant audit logging display.
   - Comprehensive audit trail display concepts.

3. âœ… **Design Standardization & Demo Prep**
   - Master Distributor sidebar matches Admin sidebar design.
   - Professional Heroicons used in navigation.
   - Consistent UI/UX (spacing, typography, colors).
   - User profile and Sign Out correctly positioned.
   - Focused demo presentation for Master Distributor workflow prepared.

4. âœ… **Security & Compliance (Initial UI/Concepts)**
   - AWS KMS encryption concepts for PHI (visual cues/placeholders).
   - Role-based access control UI elements.
   - PHI access logging display concepts.
   - Territory-based processing UI concepts.
   - Real-time audit trails display concepts.

### Current Active Phases & Tasks:
1. ðŸ”„ **Phase 11: Backend Integration for New Workflow**
   - Implement WebSocket services for real-time order status updates.
   - Ensure database persistence for new order states, shipping details, and document metadata.
   - Develop/Integrate API endpoints for shipping form, document uploads, and "Mark as Received".
   - Build backend logic for analytics data aggregation (delivery times, overdue orders).

2. ðŸ”„ **Phase 9: Security & Compliance Hardening**
   - Conduct comprehensive HIPAA compliance review (PHI handling, encryption, access controls).
   - Perform security penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
   - Audit access controls and territory isolation mechanisms rigorously.
   - Verify encryption of all PHI at rest and in transit.
   - Review and enhance audit logging for all critical operations.

### Upcoming Phases (Post Current Sprints):
1.  Phase 12: Advanced Analytics (Backend data processing, AI/ML models).
2.  Phase 13: Testing & Quality Assurance (Full E2E, Load, Security, UAT).
3.  Phase 14: Deployment & DevOps (Production setup, CI/CD refinement, Monitoring).

### Files Potentially Being Created/Updated (Backend Focus):
-   `backend/app/api/orders/order_routes.py` (updates for new status, shipping, documents)
-   `backend/app/api/orders/order_schemas.py` (updates for new data structures)
-   `backend/app/services/order_service.py` (logic for new workflow)
-   `backend/app/services/websocket_service.py` (new or enhanced for order status)
-   `backend/app/models/order_models.py` (or similar, if schema changes needed)
-   `backend/migrations/` (new migration scripts if schema changes)
-   `backend/app/services/shipping_service.py` (new or enhanced)
-   `backend/app/api/documents/routes.py` (if new document handling specific to orders)
-   Security and Compliance related scripts/configurations in `backend/app/core/` or `backend/app/services/`.

### Recent Achievements (from completed Frontend Phase):
- Completed Frontend for Order Management System (new workflow).
- Implemented comprehensive frontend status tracking UI.
- Finalized UI for HIPAA-compliant audit system display.
- Standardized UI/UX and prepared for demo.
- Added frontend performance optimizations for new components.
- Implemented frontend for real-time notification display.

### Next Immediate Steps:
1.  Execute demo of the frontend workflow.
2.  Develop and test backend APIs for order status, shipping info, and document uploads.
3.  Implement WebSocket service for real-time order status updates.
4.  Begin formal HIPAA compliance review and schedule penetration testing.
5.  Update database schema and implement persistence logic for new order data.

### Note:
Task 3.2 (Patient Management System) from `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` remains paused. Current focus is on making the new order management workflow fully functional (backend integration) and ensuring the entire system is secure and compliant before broader testing and deployment.
