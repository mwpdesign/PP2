### âœ… MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Authentication & Routing System Overhaul (Phase 11)
**CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENT**: Completely resolved authentication and routing issues that were preventing proper user role-based dashboard access.

#### Latest Session Achievements âœ…
- **Route Order Fix**: Reordered routes in App.tsx to prevent conflicts - moved `/dashboard` route to top priority and doctor routes before distributor routes
- **Logout Functionality Restored**: Fixed missing logout button in doctor sidebar by:
  - Passing navigation array with logout to Sidebar component
  - Adding dedicated logout button in Sidebar component as fallback
  - Updating navigation paths to use correct `/doctor/*` routes
- **Navigation Path Corrections**: Updated all doctor navigation paths to use proper `/doctor/*` routes instead of root paths
- **Dynamic User Info**: Updated sidebar to display actual user information from auth context
- **Cross-Role Testing**: Verified routing works correctly for all user roles:
  - Admin â†’ `/admin/dashboard` âœ…
  - Doctor â†’ `/doctor/dashboard` âœ…
  - All other roles â†’ their respective dashboards âœ…

#### Complete Authentication System âœ…
- **8 User Role System**: All user roles working with proper authentication and routing:
  1. **Admin** (`admin@healthcare.local` / `admin123`) â†’ `/admin/dashboard`
  2. **Doctor** (`doctor@healthcare.local` / `doctor123`) â†’ `/doctor/dashboard`
  3. **IVR** (`ivr@healthcare.local` / `ivr123`) â†’ `/ivr/dashboard`
  4. **Master Distributor** (`distributor@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) â†’ `/distributor/dashboard`
  5. **CHP Admin** (`chp@healthcare.local` / `chp123`) â†’ `/chp/dashboard`
  6. **Distributor** (`distributor2@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) â†’ `/distributor-regional/dashboard`
  7. **Sales** (`sales@healthcare.local` / `sales123`) â†’ `/sales/dashboard`
  8. **Shipping and Logistics** (`logistics@healthcare.local` / `logistics123`) â†’ `/logistics/dashboard`
- **Backend Profile Fix**: Fixed profile endpoint to include role information from JWT token
- **DashboardRouter**: Intelligent routing component directing users to correct dashboards
- **Complete Flow**: Login â†’ JWT token â†’ Profile endpoint â†’ Dashboard routing â†’ Logout all working
