feat: Convert doctor registration from modal to dedicated page

- Removed AddDoctorModal component and modal-related state
- Created dedicated /sales/doctors/add route with full page form
- Updated navigation to use routing instead of modal triggers
- Preserved all 48 form fields and validation logic
- Improved UX with better space utilization and navigation
- Fixed modal transparency and scrolling issues
- Added proper back navigation and breadcrumbs

This change provides better user experience, especially for the complex
multi-section doctor registration form with 48+ fields.
