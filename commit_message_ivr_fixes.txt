fix(ivr): resolve JSX errors and implement dynamic approval data flow

Fixed critical post-commit issues and enhanced IVR workflow:

Bug Fixes:
- Fixed JSX fragment error in doctor/ivr/[id].tsx preventing approved IVR viewing
- Resolved authentication token key mismatch (token → authToken)
- Fixed UUID format issues (IVR-001 → proper UUIDs)

Enhancements:
- IVR Results now displays actual approval data instead of hardcoded values
  - Shows entered coverage % (not hardcoded 20%)
  - Displays actual deductible (not $1500)
  - Shows actual copay and OOP max from approval form
  - Includes coverage notes from approval
- Enhanced approval success message with coverage details
- Added "Order Products" button for approved IVRs in doctor view
- Complete data flow: Approval Form → Success Message → Results → Doctor View

Documentation:
- Created comprehensive documentation suite
  - IVR workflow complete guide
  - API documentation with examples
  - Authentication system docs
  - Database schema documentation
  - Deployment guide for all environments
- Added test pages for workflow validation

Testing:
- test_ivr_auth.html - Authentication testing
- test_ivr_approval_workflow.html - Complete workflow testing
- All user credentials documented

The IVR workflow is now production-ready with complete approval-to-order functionality.
