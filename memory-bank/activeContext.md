# Active Context - Healthcare IVR Platform

## Current Focus
The project has successfully completed the major workflow optimization phase and enterprise design standardization, implementing a streamlined order management system with consistent professional UI across all user roles.

### Key Achievements
- **Workflow Consolidation**: Eliminated redundant Order Queue component
- **Streamlined Status Progression**: Implemented clear three-stage workflow (Pending → Preparing → Shipped)
- **One-Click Operations**: Intuitive status updates with minimal user friction
- **Integrated Shipping Form**: Comprehensive shipping interface with carrier selection and document upload
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Delivery performance tracking and overdue alert system
- **Doctor Integration**: "Mark as Received" functionality for delivery confirmation
- **Design Standardization**: Master Distributor sidebar now matches Admin sidebar design exactly

### Active Decisions
1. **Order Management System**
   - Consolidated pre-ship workflow into single component
   - One-click progression from Pending → Preparing → Shipped
   - Integrated shipping form with comprehensive data capture
   - Recently shipped orders visible for 24 hours for visibility

2. **Shipping & Logistics Enhancement**
   - Focus on post-ship delivery management
   - Real-time delivery performance analytics
   - Overdue detection and alerting
   - Doctor interaction for delivery confirmation

3. **Navigation Simplification**
   - Eliminated "Order Queue" from navigation
   - Clear two-component system: Order Management + Shipping & Logistics
   - Logical handoff between pre-ship and post-ship workflows

4. **Enterprise Design Consistency**
   - Master Distributor sidebar standardized to match Admin design
   - Professional Heroicons throughout navigation
   - Consistent spacing, typography, and color scheme
   - Proper user profile placement and Sign Out positioning

## Next Phase Focus
The workflow optimization and design standardization are complete and functional. Future enhancements could include:

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket
   - Database persistence for workflow states
   - API endpoints for shipping integration

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Carrier performance comparison
   - Delivery time predictions
   - Regional performance insights

3. **Automation Features**
   - Auto-delivery detection
   - Smart carrier selection
   - Bulk order processing

### Current Considerations
- System is ready for production workflow testing
- All protection zones (doctor/admin areas) remained untouched
- Professional enterprise-grade UI maintained throughout
- Consistent design language across all user roles

## Working Environment
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Status: Fully functional streamlined workflow with consistent design
- Server: Running on localhost:3000
