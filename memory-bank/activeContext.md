   - Focused navigation on core workflow features
   - Clean, professional presentation ready
   - Easy post-demo restoration with TODO comments

## Next Phase Focus
The workflow optimization, design standardization, and demo preparation are complete and functional. Future enhancements could include:

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Real-time status updates via WebSocket
   - Database persistence for workflow states
   - API endpoints for shipping integration

2. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Carrier performance comparison
   - Delivery time predictions
   - Regional performance insights

3. **Automation Features**
   - Auto-delivery detection
   - Smart carrier selection
   - Bulk order processing

### Current Considerations
- System is ready for production workflow testing
- All protection zones (doctor/admin areas) remained untouched
- Professional enterprise-grade UI maintained throughout
- Consistent design language across all user roles
- Demo-ready presentation with focused navigation

## Working Environment
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
