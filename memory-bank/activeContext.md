# Active Context - Healthcare IVR Platform

## üö® CRITICAL BACKEND CRISIS - IMMEDIATE ATTENTION REQUIRED

### EMERGENCY STATUS: Backend Server Down
**Crisis**: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app.core.auth'
**Impact**: Complete backend failure - server cannot start
**Root Cause**: Multiple API files importing from non-existent `app.core.auth` module
**Discovery**: The correct auth functions are in `app.core.security`, not `app.core.auth`

### Critical Import Issues Discovered
1. **Wrong Import Path**: All files importing `from app.core.auth import get_current_user`
2. **Correct Path**: Should be `from app.core.security import get_current_user`
3. **Missing Function**: `get_current_territory` function doesn't exist anywhere but is being imported
4. **Affected Files**: 7 files with broken imports causing complete backend failure

### Files Requiring Emergency Fix
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auto_population.py` (Line 13)
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/voice.py` (Line 15)
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/delegation.py` (Line 13)
- `backend/app/api/orders/order_routes.py` (Line 5)
- `backend/app/api/realtime/routes.py` (Line 13)
- `backend/app/api/compliance/routes.py` (Line 10)
- `backend/app/api/security/routes.py` (Line 10)

### Available Functions in app.core.security
‚úÖ `get_current_user` - EXISTS
‚úÖ `verify_token` - EXISTS
‚ùå `get_current_territory` - DOES NOT EXIST

### Emergency Fix Strategy
1. **Fix Import Paths**: Change all `app.core.auth` imports to `app.core.security`
2. **Remove Territory References**: Remove all `get_current_territory` imports and usage
3. **Simplify Authentication**: Use basic user authentication without territory complexity
4. **Test Server Start**: Verify backend starts successfully after fixes

### Priority Level: P0 - BLOCKING
This crisis is blocking:
- Phase 2 completion verification
- Backend server startup
- All API endpoint functionality
- Development workflow continuation

## Current Focus
