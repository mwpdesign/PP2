# Active Context - Healthcare IVR Platform

## Current Focus
The project has successfully completed FIVE major milestones:

1. **Workflow Optimization & Design Standardization**: Implemented a streamlined three-stage order management system (Pending → Preparing → Shipped), achieved consistent professional UI across roles, and prepared the platform for demo presentation.

2. **Authentication & Routing System Overhaul**: ✅ **CRITICAL MILESTONE COMPLETED** - Completely resolved authentication and routing issues that were preventing proper user role-based dashboard access.

3. **Routing & Navigation Fixes**: ✅ **MILESTONE COMPLETED** - Fixed critical routing conflicts and restored logout functionality across all user roles.

4. **CORS and Middleware Configuration**: ✅ **MILESTONE COMPLETED** - Implemented comprehensive CORS configuration and security middleware for HIPAA-compliant communication between frontend and backend services.

5. **Login Interface Branding Transformation**: ✅ **LATEST MILESTONE COMPLETED** - Completed comprehensive rebranding of login interface from "Healthcare IVR Platform" to professional "Wound Care Portal" with Clear Health Pass branding, premium styling, and enhanced user experience.

**FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION & BRANDING NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL**: The login interface now features professional wound care portal branding with Clear Health Pass logo, optimized sizing, clean styling, and proper visual hierarchy for a million-dollar application appearance.

The primary focus has now shifted to:
1. **Backend Integration**: Connecting the newly refined frontend workflows to backend services. This includes implementing real-time status updates via WebSockets, ensuring database persistence for all workflow states, and developing/integrating API endpoints for the enhanced shipping and order management functionalities.
2. **Security & Compliance Hardening (Phase 9)**: Conducting a comprehensive HIPAA compliance review, performing security penetration testing, auditing access controls, verifying encryption mechanisms, and testing territory isolation.

  1. **Admin** (`admin@healthcare.local` / `admin123`) - System administration
  2. **Doctor** (`doctor@healthcare.local` / `doctor123`) - Medical provider access
  3. **IVR** (`ivr@healthcare.local` / `ivr123`) - Interactive Voice Response system
  4. **Master Distributor** (`distributor@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) - Regional distribution management
  5. **CHP Admin** (`chp@healthcare.local` / `chp123`) - Community Health Program administration
  6. **Distributor** (`distributor2@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) - Local distribution operations
  7. **Sales** (`sales@healthcare.local` / `sales123`) - Sales representative tools
  8. **Shipping and Logistics** (`logistics@healthcare.local` / `logistics123`) - Logistics operations
- **Dashboard Routing System**: Created DashboardRouter component that intelligently directs users to role-specific dashboards
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Implemented simple, consistent dashboard components for all 8 user roles with standardized design pattern
- **AdminRoute Component Fix**: Fixed critical routing bug that was misdirecting users to wrong dashboards
- **Complete Authentication Flow**: Login → JWT token generation → Profile endpoint → Dashboard routing all working correctly
- **Server Management**: Resolved port conflicts and established clean server startup/shutdown procedures
- **End-to-End Testing**: Verified all 8 user credentials work correctly with proper dashboard routing

#### Workflow Optimization & Design Standardization ✅ COMPLETED
- **Workflow Consolidation**: Eliminated redundant `Order Queue` component, streamlining to a two-component system: `Order Management` (pre-ship) and `Shipping & Logistics` (post-ship).
- **Streamlined Status Progression**: Implemented intuitive three-stage workflow (Pending → Preparing → Shipped) with one-click operations.
- **Integrated Shipping Form**: Developed a comprehensive shipping interface with carrier selection, tracking, document upload, etc.
- **Enhanced Analytics Foundation**: Laid groundwork for delivery performance tracking and overdue alert systems (backend integration pending).

## Next Phase Focus
With the frontend workflow/UI/UX, complete authentication/routing system, AND navigation fixes all finalized, the immediate focus is on backend development to make the order management features fully functional and to conduct rigorous security and compliance verification.

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend - Order Workflow Integration**
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time order status updates (Pending, Preparing, Shipped, Delivered, Overdue).
   - Ensure database persistence for all order states, shipping details, and uploaded documents.
   - Develop/Integrate API endpoints to support the shipping form (carrier selection, tracking number, document linkage).
   - Implement API logic for "Mark as Received" by doctors.

2. **Backend - Analytics Data Population**
   - Develop backend processes to feed data for delivery performance tracking and overdue alerts.

3. **Security & Compliance (Phase 9)**
   - Execute HIPAA compliance review checklist.
   - Conduct penetration testing.
   - Perform detailed audit of access controls and territory isolation.
   - Verify encryption of PHI at rest and in transit.

### Current Considerations
- The frontend for the streamlined order workflow is functionally complete and demo-ready.
- The authentication and routing system is fully operational for all 8 user roles with all navigation working correctly.
- All previously defined protection zones (doctor/admin areas) remained untouched and secure during the UI/workflow overhaul.
- The system needs robust backend support to bring the new frontend workflows to life with real data.
- Security and compliance checks are critical before any broader user testing or staging deployment.
