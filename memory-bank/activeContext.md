# Active Context - Healthcare IVR Platform

## Current Focus
The project has successfully completed the major workflow optimization, enterprise design standardization, and demo preparation phase. This involved implementing a streamlined three-stage order management system (Pending → Preparing → Shipped), achieving a consistent professional UI across roles (notably aligning Master Distributor and Admin sidebars), and ensuring the platform is demo-ready.

**CRITICAL MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Authentication system is now fully operational after resolving a critical issue where UserProfile model rejected .local development domains. Complete authentication flow (login, JWT generation, profile endpoint) is working perfectly.

The primary focus has now shifted to:
1.  **Backend Integration**: Connecting the newly refined frontend workflows to backend services. This includes implementing real-time status updates via WebSockets, ensuring database persistence for all workflow states, and developing/integrating API endpoints for the enhanced shipping and order management functionalities.
2.  **Security & Compliance Hardening (Phase 9)**: Conducting a comprehensive HIPAA compliance review, performing security penetration testing, auditing access controls, verifying encryption mechanisms, and testing territory isolation.

### Key Achievements (Recently Completed Phase)
- **Authentication System Fix**: ✅ RESOLVED critical authentication flow issue - UserProfile model now accepts .local development domains
  - Login endpoint (200 OK) ✅
  - JWT token generation ✅
  - Profile endpoint (200 OK) ✅
  - Mock authentication functional ✅
  - Test credentials verified: admin@healthcare.local/admin123, doctor@healthcare.local/doctor123, ivr@healthcare.local/ivr123
- **Workflow Consolidation**: Eliminated redundant `Order Queue` component, streamlining to a two-component system: `Order Management` (pre-ship) and `Shipping & Logistics` (post-ship).
- **Streamlined Status Progression**: Implemented intuitive three-stage workflow (Pending → Preparing → Shipped) with one-click operations.
- **Integrated Shipping Form**: Developed a comprehensive shipping interface with carrier selection, tracking, document upload, etc.
- **Enhanced Analytics Foundation**: Laid groundwork for delivery performance tracking and overdue alert systems (backend integration pending).
- **Doctor Integration Point**: Frontend "Mark as Received" functionality for delivery confirmation designed (backend pending).
- **Design Standardization**: Master Distributor sidebar now matches Admin sidebar design exactly, using professional Heroicons and consistent styling. User profile and Sign Out are correctly positioned.
- **Demo Preparation**: Cleaned up Master Distributor sidebar (temporarily removing "Manage Network" and "Settings" with TODOs for restoration) for a focused, professional demo.

### Active Decisions
1.  **Order Management System**
    *   Frontend workflow (Pending → Preparing → Shipped) is finalized.
    *   Integrated shipping form (frontend) is complete.
    *   Recently shipped orders visible for 24 hours for visibility (frontend).
    *   **Focus**: Backend implementation for status changes, data persistence, and API support.
2.  **Shipping & Logistics Enhancement**
    *   Frontend designed for post-ship delivery management, real-time analytics display, overdue alerts, and doctor confirmation.
    *   **Focus**: Backend data feeds for analytics, alert logic, and doctor interaction APIs.
3.  **Navigation Simplification**
    *   "Order Queue" eliminated. Logical handoff between `Order Management` and `Shipping & Logistics` defined in frontend.
4.  **Enterprise Design Consistency**
    *   Standardized sidebars (Admin, Master Distributor) and overall UI/UX are complete.
5.  **Demo Optimization**
    *   Temporarily streamlined Master Distributor sidebar is complete and ready.

## Next Phase Focus
With the frontend workflow and UI/UX for order management and demo presentation finalized, the immediate focus is on backend development to make these features fully functional and to conduct rigorous security and compliance verification.

### Immediate Priorities
1.  **Backend - Order Workflow Integration**
    *   Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time order status updates (Pending, Preparing, Shipped, Delivered, Overdue).
    *   Ensure database persistence for all order states, shipping details, and uploaded documents.
    *   Develop/Integrate API endpoints to support the shipping form (carrier selection, tracking number, document linkage).
    *   Implement API logic for "Mark as Received" by doctors.
2.  **Backend - Analytics Data Population**
    *   Develop backend processes to feed data for delivery performance tracking and overdue alerts.
3.  **Security & Compliance (Phase 9)**
    *   Execute HIPAA compliance review checklist.
    *   Conduct penetration testing.
    *   Perform detailed audit of access controls and territory isolation.
    *   Verify encryption of PHI at rest and in transit.

### Current Considerations
- The frontend for the streamlined order workflow is functionally complete and demo-ready.
- All previously defined protection zones (doctor/admin areas) remained untouched and secure during the UI/workflow overhaul.
- The system needs robust backend support to bring the new frontend workflows to life with real data.
- Security and compliance checks are critical before any broader user testing or staging deployment.

## Working Environment
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Status: Frontend for streamlined workflow and demo is complete. Backend integration for this new workflow is pending.
- Server: Local frontend server (localhost:3000) operational for demo. Backend server requires updates for new workflow.
- Demo: Ready for presentation of the frontend workflow.

## Recent Changes
- Eliminated `Order Queue` component.
- Enhanced `Order Fulfillment Dashboard` to `Order Management` (pre-ship focus).
- Redesigned `Shipping & Logistics` for delivery tracking and post-ship management (frontend).
- Implemented one-click status progression (Pending → Preparing → Shipped) on the frontend.
- Added comprehensive shipping form with document upload (frontend).
- Designed frontend for delivery analytics and overdue detection.
- Standardized Master Distributor sidebar to match Admin design, including Heroicons and user profile placement.
- Temporarily hid "Manage Network" and "Settings" in Master Distributor sidebar for demo clarity (with TODOs for easy restoration).

## Next Steps
1.  **Execute Demo Presentation** of the finalized frontend workflow.
2.  **Backend Development Sprint**:
    *   Implement WebSocket services for order status.
    *   Develop APIs for shipping form data and document uploads.
    *   Ensure database schema supports new workflow and persist all relevant data.
    *   Build logic for analytics data aggregation.
3.  **Security & Compliance Sprint (Parallel to Backend)**:
    *   Begin HIPAA compliance review.
    *   Schedule and start penetration testing.
4.  **Stakeholder Feedback**: Gather feedback from demo to inform backend priorities and any minor UI tweaks.
5.  **Post-Demo Restoration**: Restore full Master Distributor navigation items.

## Active Issues
- **Backend Implementation Gap**: All new frontend workflows (order status changes, shipping form submission, document uploads, analytics display) require backend logic and API endpoints.
- **Data Persistence**: No backend mechanism yet to save states of the new workflow (e.g., "Preparing" status, shipping form data).
- Security and compliance testing for the new workflow components is pending.

## Documentation Status
- Frontend workflow optimization, design standardization, and demo preparation phases are complete.
- Documentation for these frontend changes is implicitly captured here in `activeContext.md` and corresponding `progress.md` updates.
- Backend API documentation will need updates as new endpoints are developed.
- Security documentation will be updated based on Phase 9 findings.
