# Active Context - Healthcare IVR Platform

## Current Focus
The project has successfully completed TWO major milestones:

1. **Workflow Optimization & Design Standardization**: Implemented a streamlined three-stage order management system (Pending â†’ Preparing â†’ Shipped), achieved consistent professional UI across roles, and prepared the platform for demo presentation.

2. **Authentication & Routing System Overhaul**: âœ… **CRITICAL MILESTONE COMPLETED** - Completely resolved authentication and routing issues that were preventing proper user role-based dashboard access.

**AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL**: After discovering and fixing the root cause (backend profile endpoint not returning role information), we now have a complete authentication flow working for all 8 user roles with proper dashboard routing.

The primary focus has now shifted to:
1. **Backend Integration**: Connecting the newly refined frontend workflows to backend services. This includes implementing real-time status updates via WebSockets, ensuring database persistence for all workflow states, and developing/integrating API endpoints for the enhanced shipping and order management functionalities.
2. **Security & Compliance Hardening (Phase 9)**: Conducting a comprehensive HIPAA compliance review, performing security penetration testing, auditing access controls, verifying encryption mechanisms, and testing territory isolation.

### Key Achievements (Recently Completed)

#### Authentication & Routing System Overhaul âœ… COMPLETED
- **Root Cause Discovery & Fix**: Backend profile endpoint was NOT returning role information, causing frontend to lose JWT role data when merging profile API response. Fixed by adding role field to UserProfile model and updating profile endpoint.
- **Comprehensive User Role System**: Created complete user management system with 8 distinct user roles:
  1. **Admin** (`admin@healthcare.local` / `admin123`) - System administration
  2. **Doctor** (`doctor@healthcare.local` / `doctor123`) - Medical provider access
  3. **IVR** (`ivr@healthcare.local` / `ivr123`) - Interactive Voice Response system
  4. **Master Distributor** (`distributor@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) - Regional distribution management
  5. **CHP Admin** (`chp@healthcare.local` / `chp123`) - Community Health Program administration
  6. **Distributor** (`distributor2@healthcare.local` / `distributor123`) - Local distribution operations
  7. **Sales** (`sales@healthcare.local` / `sales123`) - Sales representative tools
  8. **Shipping and Logistics** (`logistics@healthcare.local` / `logistics123`) - Logistics operations
- **Dashboard Routing System**: Created DashboardRouter component that intelligently directs users to role-specific dashboards
- **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Implemented simple, consistent dashboard components for all 8 user roles with standardized design pattern

## Next Phase Focus
With both the frontend workflow/UI/UX AND the complete authentication/routing system finalized, the immediate focus is on backend development to make the order management features fully functional and to conduct rigorous security and compliance verification.

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Backend - Order Workflow Integration**
   - Implement WebSocket endpoints for real-time order status updates (Pending, Preparing, Shipped, Delivered, Overdue).
   - Ensure database persistence for all order states, shipping details, and uploaded documents.
   - Develop/Integrate API endpoints to support the shipping form (carrier selection, tracking number, document linkage).
   - Implement API logic for "Mark as Received" by doctors.

2. **Backend - Analytics Data Population**
   - Develop backend processes to feed data for delivery performance tracking and overdue alerts.

3. **Security & Compliance (Phase 9)**
   - Execute HIPAA compliance review checklist.
   - Conduct penetration testing.
   - Perform detailed audit of access controls and territory isolation.
   - Verify encryption of PHI at rest and in transit.

### Current Considerations
- The frontend for the streamlined order workflow is functionally complete and demo-ready.
- The authentication and routing system is fully operational for all 8 user roles.
- All previously defined protection zones (doctor/admin areas) remained untouched and secure during the UI/workflow overhaul.
- The system needs robust backend support to bring the new frontend workflows to life with real data.
- Security and compliance checks are critical before any broader user testing or staging deployment.
