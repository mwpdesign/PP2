## Known Issues

### Current Issues
1. **Backend Implementation Gap**: All new frontend workflows (order status changes, shipping form submission, document uploads, analytics display) require backend logic and API endpoints.
2. **Data Persistence**: No backend mechanism yet to save states of the new workflow (e.g., "Preparing" status, shipping form data).
3. **WebSocket Implementation**: Real-time updates for order status changes need WebSocket backend implementation.

### Resolved Issues ✅
1. **CORS Configuration**: ✅ Fixed - Comprehensive CORS configuration implemented with environment-based settings
2. **Security Headers**: ✅ Fixed - HIPAA-compliant security headers implemented via middleware
3. **Authentication System**: ✅ Fixed - Complete 8-role authentication system working correctly
4. **Routing Conflicts**: ✅ Fixed - All user roles route correctly to their dashboards
5. **Logout Functionality**: ✅ Fixed - Logout working across all user roles
6. **Mock Services Security**: ✅ Fixed - Removed wildcard CORS origins from mock services
7. **Request Logging**: ✅ Fixed - Comprehensive audit trail with request IDs implemented
8. **Rate Limiting**: ✅ Fixed - API protection with rate limiting implemented

### Backend & Integration
1. **Functionality Gap**: New frontend order workflow (status changes, shipping form, doc uploads) lacks backend implementation.
2. **Data Persistence**: Order states from the new workflow, shipping details, and document metadata are not yet saved to the database.
3. **Analytics Data**: Backend logic to populate analytics dashboards (delivery times, overdue orders) is missing.
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket infrastructure for pushing real-time order status updates to the frontend is not yet built.

### Security & Compliance
1. Penetration testing for the new workflow components is pending.
2. Territory isolation for the new order states and data needs backend validation.
3. Comprehensive encryption audit for new data flows (e.g., shipping documents) required.
4. Access control review for APIs supporting the new workflow is needed.

### Documentation
1. Backend API documentation needs to be created/updated for new endpoints supporting the order workflow.
2. Security procedures documentation to be updated based on Phase 9 findings.
3. Emergency protocol documentation needs review in light of new workflows.

## Next Milestones

### Short Term (Current Sprints)
1. **Demo Presentation**: Showcase the completed frontend workflow and UI with working authentication for all user roles.
2. **Backend - Order Workflow API Development**: Build and test core APIs for order status, shipping info, and document uploads.
3. **Backend - WebSocket Service**: Implement initial WebSocket service for order status updates.
4. **Database - Schema Updates & Persistence**: Modify schema if needed and implement persistence for new order data.
5. **Security - HIPAA Compliance Review Start**: Begin formal HIPAA checklist review.
6. **Security - Penetration Testing Setup**: Plan and schedule penetration testing.

### Long Term
