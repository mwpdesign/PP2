## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- User table enhancements
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_step INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN onboarding_skipped BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN first_login_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Onboarding progress tracking
CREATE TABLE onboarding_progress (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    step_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    step_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
    completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    data JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```
